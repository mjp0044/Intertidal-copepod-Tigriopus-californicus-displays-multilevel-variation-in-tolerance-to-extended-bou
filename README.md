# Instructions for utilizing scripts and data sheets. 

Each R script will have the required .csv files listed at the start of the script when you open it up in R. The scripts and required .csv files are saved as individual files in this repository. 

Exceptions to the above instructions: 
1) The "Combined Resp Script.R" script imports raw respirometry files in one at a time, based on the user's choice. 
These raw respirometry scripts can be found in the zip folder called "All Individual Respirometry Raw Data Files". Simply save these files in your R working directory and you can import them into the combined resp script one at a time.

2) The DO Script.R script imports oxygen data from the two text files "SH_pool3_30JUN-27SEP_Full.txt" and "BOB_pool2_28JUN-27SEP_Full.txt". These are imported as text files and not .csv files in the DO Script.R script. 





# Below you can find animated versions of figure 1 from the manuscript main text. These show the rise and fall of dissolved oxygen and temperature in the SH and BOB splashpools.
