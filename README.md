# Instructions for utilizing scripts and data sheets. 

Each R script will have the required .csv files listed at the start of the script when you open it up in R. The scripts and required .csv files are saved as individual files in this repository. 

Exceptions to the above instructions: 
1) The "Combined Resp Script.R" script imports raw respirometry files in one at a time, based on the user's choice. 
These raw respirometry scripts can be found in the zip folder called "All Individual Respirometry Raw Data Files". Simply save these files in your R working directory and you can import them into the combined resp script one at a time.

2) The DO Script.R script imports oxygen data from the two text files "SH_pool3_30JUN-27SEP_Full.txt" and "BOB_pool2_28JUN-27SEP_Full.txt". These are imported as text files and not .csv files in the DO Script.R script.

### These show the rise and fall of dissolved oxygen and temperature in the SH and BOB splashpools. 
*Dissolved oxygen and temperature regimes in copepod-inhabited splash pools at Strawberry Hill (SH) and Boiler Bay (BOB), Oregon. Data collected at 10-min intervals from 01 July through 27 September 2022. Zoom-in of a 2-day and 2-week period for SH and BOB sites showing anoxia during the night. Black lines represent dissolved oxygen in mg O2 l-1 and the blue line shows the temperature in Celsius. Red dotted lines mark 0 mg O2 l-1 (anoxia), the orange dotted lines represent 2 mg O2 l-1 (severe hypoxia for most organisms), the green dotted lines represent 7.4 mg O2 l-1 (normoxic conditions at 20°C). The blue dotted lines indicate the incubator temperature of 20°C used in our laboratory assays. The yellow shading starts and ends at the sunrise and sunset times for each day.*
